## Usage
* **g+help** - Provides the bot's commands via Direct Message
* **g+create** - Interactive giveaway setup
* **g+start \<time> [winners] [prize]** - Starts a new giveaway in the current channel. Users can react with a ðŸŽ‰ to enter the giveaway. The time can be in seconds, minutes, hours, or days. Specify the time unit with an "s", "m", "h", or "d", for example `30s` or `2h`. If you include a number of winners, it must be in the form #w, for example `2w` or `5w`.
* **g+reroll [messsageId]** - Re-rolls a winner. If you provided a message ID, it rerolls the giveaway at that ID. If you leave it blank, it looks in the current channel for the most recent giveaway and rerolls from that.
* **g+end [messageId]** - Ends a giveaway immediately. If you provided a message ID it will end the giveaway at that ID. If you leave it blank, it looks in the current channel for the most recent giveaway and ends that.
* **g+list** - Lists currently-running giveaways on the server.
